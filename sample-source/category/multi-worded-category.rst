multi-worded category
=====================

It's probably fine to have just the article "slug" IDs printed in the blog pages, but the titles can be extracted for the list too for a bit more pretty presentation.

The slug can be an internal key only. Doesn't need to match the title or anything, although that would be a simple choice.
