year listing
============

But these cannot have languages because the urls would be identical!
HELP!!

So, have a bilingual template and discuss both languages there briefly?
Or resort to /<language>/2020/etc/title/? But the page title already defines the url.

The same trouble would be with categories that would share the same name in both languages.
At least there one variant could have a language postfix and it would be acceptable.

What about the year number?
Dig it from the url in the template?
Oh shit, that's text processing and text processing is bad.
