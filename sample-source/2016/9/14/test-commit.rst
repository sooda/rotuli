===================

This is just a test page, and all of the yaml is also still just initial pseudocode.
If the original url does not start with a slash, then it's relative to the current one.
How should the url be specified in that? foo? foo/? foo.rst? Minimize writing while keeping it explicit enough, uggh?

Next paragraph.

Last paragraph.
