My name is Konsta "sooda" Hölttä, and I'm an enginerd from Finland.
I like to spend my time programming and building all sorts of things, often combined with electronics.
This blog is a diary to hold documentation of my tinkerings and thoughts.
The text is just disorganized stream of conciousness, and often half intentionally entertaining.
