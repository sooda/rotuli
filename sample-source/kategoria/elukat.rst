Should the category name be written in the post language?
Up to the site designer.
Pros and cons in both.
With just one category group the language field can be used to filter them in any case, and the category titles should specify the language anyway.

this gets no pages beceause the matching page is contained in two categories, so the exact array
content does not match :(
